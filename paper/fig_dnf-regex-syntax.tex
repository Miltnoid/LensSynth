\caption{DNF Regex Syntax\bcp{Why the dot after conjuncts?  Ah, now I see;
    OK, but maybe it's better to choose two different kinds of brackets
    instead of distinguishing with . and + (I was also confused by the + --
    thought it must mean some kind of repetition).  How about
    $\langle...\rangle$ for disjuncts and $[...]$ for conjuncts?  (This is a
  bit suggestive of type-theoretic notation.)  Or how about ``hollow square
  brackets'' for conjuncts (using some kind of square brackets seems good,
  since they are ordered) and ``hollow set braces'' for disjuncts?  We
  should try to get this right, since these widgets are our core technical
  device.}}

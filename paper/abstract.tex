The language of lenses expresses programs which can convert between source and
target regular languages.
We tackle the task of synthesizing these programs through the regular expressions
of their types.
This is difficult because we cannot use basic type directed synthesis techniques,
as there are many equivalences in the types of these regular expressions.
We do this by developing a language for partially normalized regular expressions,
and searching through those regular expressions for two that have a lens between
them which can be synthesized in a type-directed way.
We develop strategies for efficiently enacting this search and synthesis,
and evaluate our strategies against a suite of microbenchmarks and linux
configuration files.

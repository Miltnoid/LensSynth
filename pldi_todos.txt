Testing
    More tests on random augeas examples
        Show that we didn't "train" our algorithm against some specific set
Show we are unique
    Find examples where we can do it, where other things can't
        FlashExtract most important, as it's closest
             FlashExtract has no (or) operation, just (.), (*), and (?), what
               important types of programs does that miss out on?
Classify what types of inputs are difficult
    Is there a nice way to predict which are bad and which are good
        Maybe a 0 to 1 scale or something?
        People could watch as they add more things to context, as their number
          goes down further and further, woo hoo!
Paper
    Still need to write up some of the implementation sections
    That which is written up MUST be revised
    IMO, if we aren't complete, we shouldn't just quietly hope nobody notices
        Maybe write up something about it's completeness, or to what extent we
          guarantee completeness, or something like that
        Maybe write up why it doesn't really matter too much

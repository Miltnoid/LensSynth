Disambiguation importance:
In automaster, I don't want to have to deal with the fact that if I
have a colon in my text when I'm not using a "type", and am instead
using a map at the start, I must be really particular

Annoyance with disambiguation with whitespace
whitespace one side (potentially empty string) whitespace other side

Not good when you write down the wrong thing, figuring out WHAT was
wrong really is difficult (I wrote down whitespace instead of nonempty
whitespace, and it was difficult to reason why things didn't work (I
think this is in major part to how boomerang prints out badly typed
lenses).

bbhosts, lotta different comments, I must write down really particularly
where the comments are allowed to go, to have safe iteration.
I also must make these non-wsp start strings

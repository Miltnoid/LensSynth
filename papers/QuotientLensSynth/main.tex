\begin{abstract} 

{\em Lenses}~\cite{Lenses} are programs that specify bidirectional
transformations between different data formats.  Writing a single lens
rather than two separate uni-directional transformations saves both
keystrokes and bugs, by reducing redundancy and by automatically
guaranteeing strong ``lens laws'' ensuring that the forward and backward
transformations interact well.
%
{\em Quotient lenses}~\cite{quotientlenses} are a generalization of lenses
where the two data formats are considered modulo some equivalence relation.
The use of quotients allows the programmer to ignore inessential differences
in the data, such as the amount of whitespace or the ordering of fields.

Quotient lenses can be difficult to program, requiring the programmer to
give both a specification for the data on each side of the lens and a
separate specification for the equivalence relations on the data.  The
programmer must also manually implement a lens program that maps between the
formats while respecting the equivalence relations---this is itself a
challenging task thanks to the restrictions on how lenses can be combined
while still satisfying the lens laws.  \bcp{Don't really understand that
  paragraph!}

This paper addresses both of these challenges\bcp{what are the two
  challenges?}. First, we propose the language of {\em Quotient Regular
  Expressions}, or QREs, which define a broad class of equivalence relations
directly on regular languages using a compact and convenient notation. This
eliminates the need to specify the data and the equivalence relation on the
data separately. We then define {\em QRE lenses}, a class of quotient lenses
that are typed using QREs, and show how to {\em synthesize} QRE lenses from
their QRE types and a set of input-output examples. Finally, we demonstrate
the applicability of this approach by synthesizing QRE lenses between
several real-world data formats from the {\tt data.gov} database.
\end{abstract}

\section{Introduction}
\bcp{Not sure there is time to fix this, but the intro seems very long and
  technical---it takes a long time to get to saying what our actual
  contributions are!  Wonder if we should move most of it to a second
  ``Example'' section.} 
{\em Bidirectional programming languages} such as
Boomerang~\cite{boomerang}, Augeas~\cite{augeas}, XSugar~\cite{xsugar},
biXid~\cite{bixid} and X/Inv~\cite{xinv}enable a programmer to express a
transformation that maps some input data to some output data, as well as a
transformation that maps the output data back into the input data in a single
expression. An example of a {\em bidirectional transformation} which we shall
revisit severally in this paper is a program which converts citation records
such as
\begin{verbatim}
@Book {conway,
  Author = "J. H. Conway",
  Title = {Regular Algebra and Finite Machines}
}
\end{verbatim}

\noindent stored in the \bibtex{} format to their equivalent representation 
\begin{verbatim}
%0 Book
%T Regular Algebra and Finite Machines
%A J. H. Conway
%F conway
\end{verbatim}

\noindent in the EndNote format, and vice versa.

Bidirectional programs have also been called {\em lenses}. Formally, Foster et
al~\cite{foster} defined a lens $\ell : S \Leftrightarrow V$ that maps between
an ``abstract" {\em source} $S$ and a ``concrete" {\em view} $V$ to be a triple
of functions $(\ell.\get, \; \ell.\lput, \; \ell.\create)$ satisfying the
following equations:\bcp{Why are we showing all the complexity of asymmetric
lenses?  We should just say that we're considering only the bijective case
for now and then just give the details of that.}
\begin{align*}
\ell.get &: S \longrightarrow V & \ell.\lput \; (\ell.\get \; s) \; s &= s\\
\ell.put &: V \longrightarrow S \longrightarrow S & \ell.\get \; (\ell.\lput \;
v \; s) &= v\\
\ell.create &: S \longrightarrow V & \ell.\lput \; (\ell.\create \; v) &= v
\end{align*} 

The $\get$ function presents a view of the data from the source, the
$\lput$ function enables an updated view to be folded back into the source, and
the $\create$ component produces a copy of the source from a view, using
defaults to fill in information that may have been discarded by the $\get$
function in producing the view. The first law states that the $\lput$ function
must restore all the information discarded by $\get$ when its arguments are an
abstract structure and a concrete structure that generates the very same
abstract structure. The second and third laws state that $\lput$ and $\create$
must propagate all of the information contained in their abstract arguments to
the concrete structure they produce. These laws express fundamental expectations
about how the components of a lens should work together.

However, the constraints that are imposed by the lens laws are sometimes too
strict. For instance, the programmer may wish to ignore updates to the data
that only change the order of fields, or add whitespace characters that in
reality are not part of the data. Foster {\em et al.\relax} therefore proposed
\textit{quotient lenses} ~\cite{quotient} as a solution to this problem.
Quotient lenses, which are implemented as a refinement of the bidirectional
string processing language Boomerang, enable a programmer to write lenses which
transform data that is quotiented out by an equivalence relation, so that
records which are equivalent to each other modulo this relation are considered
the same by the underlying lens.

Formally, given equivalence relations $\sim_S$ and $\sim_V$ defined on the
source $S$ and the view $V$ respectively, a quotient lens $q : S/{\sim_S}
\Leftrightarrow V/{\sim_V}$ is a triple of functions $(\ell.\get, \; \ell.\lput,
\; \ell.\create)$ which satisfy the lens laws up to equivalence:
\begin{align*}
\ell.get &: S \longrightarrow V & \ell.\lput \; (\ell.\get \; s) \; s &\sim_S
s\\
\ell.put &: V \longrightarrow S \longrightarrow S & \ell.\get \; (\ell.\lput \;
v \; s) &\sim_V v\\
\ell.create &: S \longrightarrow V & \ell.\lput \; (\ell.\create \; v) &\sim_V v
\end{align*}
Moreover, each of the $\get$, $\lput$ and $\create$ functions must respect
$\sim_S$ and $\sim_V$. That is, if $s \sim_S s'$ then $\get \; s \sim_V
\get \; s'$, if $s \sim_S s'$ and $v \sim_V v'$ then $\lput \; v \; s \sim_S
\lput \; v' \; s'$ and if $v \sim_V v'$, then $\create \; v \sim_S \create \;
v'$.

In Boomerang, equivalence relations are expressed using {\em canonizers}
which are functions that map members of a regular language to their canonical
representation modulo an equivalence relation. Therefore, in order to give a
specification for the data, the programmer often has to write a
regular expression which matches all possible representations of the data, and
then provide a set of canonizers which does the job of quotienting the data.

For example, suppose that the programmer wants to
derive the \bibtex{} to EndNote transformation in such a way that the program
allows for whitespace to occur arbitrarily between the words in the author and
title fields, ignores the order in which the author and title fields occur in
each record, and allows for arbitrary amounts of whitespace in between the
author and title fields. These rules allow for these two \bibtex{} citation
records to be considered the same,

\begin{verbatim}
@Book {conway,
  Author = "J. H. Conway",
  Title = {Regular Algebra and Finite Machines},
}

@Book{conway,

    Title = {Regular Algebra 
            and Finite Machines},
        
    Author = "J. H. Conway",
}
\end{verbatim}

\noindent with the EndNote records having a similar equivalence relation defined
on them.

The code sample below shows how the programmer might specify these equivalence
relations on the \bibtex{} records in Boomerang using canonizers:\bcp{Too
  big to display in-line.  Better to put it in a figure.}

\begin{verbatim}
let project (r : regexp) (s : string) = canonizer_of_lens ((del r) . (ins s))

let wsp : regexp = [ \n\t\r]+

let wsp_to_space : canonizer = project wsp " "

let valid_name : canonizer = 
name | (name . wsp_to_space . (name .wsp_to_space)* .name)

let wsp_to_and : canonizer = project (wsp . "and" . wsp) " and "

let bib_names : canonizer =  

valid_name | (valid_name . wsp_to_and . (valid_name . wsp_to_and)* . valid_name)

let bib_author : canonizer = "author = \"" . bib_names . "\""

let label : regexp = [a-zA-Z0-9]+

let title : canonizer = 
word | (word . wsp_to_space . (word . wsp_to_space)* . word)

let bib_title : canonizer = "title = {" . title . "}"

let wsp_to_comma : canonizer = project ("," . wsp) ",\n"

let first_perm : canonizer = bib_author . wsp_to_comma . bib_title

let second_perm : canonizer = bib_title . wsp_to_comma . bib_author

let bibtex : canonizer = 
"@book{" . label. wsp_to_comma . (first_perm | second_perm) . "}"
\end{verbatim}

Using the in-built \verb!canonizer_of_lens! function which extracts a canonizer
from a lens, it is easy to define a an equivalence relation that sends all
members of a regular language to a canonical representative. For example
the expression 
\begin{verbatim}
let wsp_to_space : canonizer = canonizer_of_lens ((del wsp) . (ins " "))
\end{verbatim}

\noindent defines a canonizer which sends arbitrary occurences of whitespace
characters to a single space. However, a problem arises when trying to specify
the equivalence relation which nests this projection relation with the relation
that considers all permutations of the \bibtex{} fields equivalent.

Specifically, it becomes necessary to specify each of the permutations
seperately, since Boomerang's in-built permutation combinator does not account
for separators in between the regular expressions being permuted:

\begin{verbatim}
let first_perm : canonizer = bib_author . wsp_to_comma . bib_title

let second_perm : canonizer = bib_title . wsp_to_comma . bib_author
\end{verbatim}

One possible solution is to permute the alternative canonizers

\noindent \verb!bib_author. wsp_to_comma! and \verb!bib_title . wsp_to_comma!,
but Boomerang's type-checker will reject this expression since the permutation
combinator accepts regular expressions rather than canonizers. In any case, the
regular expression
\begin{verbatim}
bib_author . wsp_to_comma . bib_title . wsp_to_comma | 
bib_title . wsp_to_comma . bib_author . wsp_to_comma
\end{verbatim}
is not equivalent to,
\begin{verbatim}
bib_author . wsp_to_comma . bib_title  | 
bib_title . wsp_to_comma . bib_author
\end{verbatim}
thus the programmer would have to write more lenses and canonizers to correct
this. Therefore, in order to utilize this trick, the programmer might choose to
specify all the regular expressions first (including the whole regular
expressions canonized by the \verb!bib_author! and \verb!bib_title!
canonizers), and then the canonizers separately. Alternatively, he/she may stick
to using canonizers and then liberally make use of the built-in
functions \verb!uncanonized_type! and \verb!canonized_type! which return the
regular expression matching all the data and the regular expression matching
the canonical representatives respectively.

In any case, all of these alternatives lead to verbose code that is
difficult to understand. Moreover, if the \bibtex{} records had 3 or more
fields or even nested permutations, then the programmer would quickly find
themselves in a bind with these workarounds.

To address this issue, we propose the language of {\em Quotient Regular
Expressions} or QREs, which express a broad class of equivalence relations
directly on regular languages using a compact and convenient notation. 

With QREs we can specify \bibtex{} records as follows:\bcp{Again, belongs in
a figure.  And, since both figures are long, maybe there is a visual way to
highlight the differences...?}

\begin{verbatim}
let wsp_to_space : canonizer = project [ \n\t\r]+ -> " "

let valid_name : canonizer = 
name | (name . wsp_to_space . (name . wsp_to_space)* . name)

let wsp_to_and : canonizer = 
project ([ \n\t\r]+ . "and" . [ \n\t\r]+) -> " and "

let bib_names : canonizer =  

valid_name | (valid_name . wsp_to_and . (valid_name . wsp_to_and)* . valid_name)

let bib_author : canonizer = "author = \"" . bib_names . "\""

let label : regexp = [a-zA-Z0-9]+

let title : canonizer = word | (word . wsp_to_space . (word . wsp_to_space)* .
word)

let bib_title : canonizer = "title = {" . title . "}"
 
let bib_perm  : canonizer = perm (label, bib_author, bib_title) with
(project ("," . [ \n\t\r]* ) -> ",\n")

let bibtex : canonizer = "@book{" . bib_perm . "}"
\end{verbatim}

The expression \verb!project [ \n\t\r]+ -> " "! is a QRE which matches any
number of whitespace characters, and then considers all strings of whitespace
characters as equivalent with a single space as the canonical representative. 
Another QRE in the example above is the

\begin{center}
\begin{verbatim}
perm (label, bib_author, bib_title) with (project ("," . [\n\t\r]* ) -> ",\n")
\end{verbatim}
\end{center}

\noindent QRE, which specifies that the label, title and author fields can occur
in any order, with the fields separated by a comma followed by arbitrary amounts
of whitespace. The canonical representation is that in which the label, author
and title fields occur in that order, separated by a comma followed a newline.
The \verb!perm! QRE is defined at the level of canonizers which allows for
easy nesting of permutations. Similarly, it is easy to specify any number of
fields within the \verb!perm! QRE.

While QREs kill two birds with one stone by specifying the
data and the equivalence relation on the data in one expression, he/she
still has to manually program the underlying lens which maps the equivalence
classes of the source data to the equivalence classes of the view data, a task
which is itself tedious and error-prone as the code snippet below illustrates:
\begin{verbatim}
let preamble : (lens in "@book{" <=> "%0 Book\n%F ") = 
    del "@book{" . ins "%0 Book\n%F "
  
let author_lens : (lens in (",\n" . bib_author) <=> ("\n" . end_author)) = 
    del ",\nauthor = \""
    . ins "\n%A "
    . valid_name
    . (del " and "
         . ins "\n"
         . (ins "%A " . valid_name . del " and " . ins "\n")*  . ins "%A "
         . valid_name
           || "")
           
let title_lens : 
(lens in ("\",\n" . bib_title . "},\n}") <=> ("\n" . end_title)) =
del "\",\ntitle = {" . ins "\n%T " . title . del "},\n}" 
    
let bib_to_end : (lens in bib_tex <=> end_note) =
preamble . label . author_lens . title_lens
\end{verbatim}

This lens transforms the \bibtex{} data to the EndNote (and vice versa) data by
matching the delimiters and separators in a bijective manner. For example,
the \verb!preamble! lens replaces the \bibtex{} preamble \verb!@book! with the
EndNote preamble \verb!%0 Book\n%F ! in the \bibtex{record}. The programmer
can ill afford to make a mistake with any one of the small but vital details
of the transformations since even a one character mistake might render the lens
incorrect. This makes lens programming tedious and error-prone.

Therefore, to address this challenge, we demonstrate how to {\em synthesize}
quotient lenses from a pair of QREs and a set of input-output example pairs.
Our key insight is to reduce the problem of synthesizing QRE lenses to the
problem of synthesizing {\em bijective lenses}, a particular subset of the
lenses that can be expressed in Boomerang. This is a problem which we solved in
our prior work ~\cite{popl18}.

Our approach is to define a class of {\em QRE lenses} which are the same as
bijective lenses with ``canonizers at the edges'' as in
Figure~\ref{fig:attheedges}. In the forward direction, a QRE lens $q$ uses the
source QRE $c$ to compute a unique representative for the data modulo the
equivalence relation defined by $c$ and then applies the $\get$ function of a
bijective lens $\ell$ to this representative. In the backward direction, $q$
operates similarly, but using the view QRE $c'$ and the $\lput$ function of
$\ell$.

\begin{figure}[t]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{attheedges}
  \caption{Quotient Lens with ``Canonizers at the Edges''\sam{This is a
      screenshot from Nate's thesis. Are we allowed to use it?}\bcp{We can
      (if we put ``from [Nate's thesis]'' in the caption), but I don't think
      we want the full complexity of asymmetric lenses here.  We should draw
      the figure again.  (I might have the OmniGraffle file for it lying
      around someplace...)}}
  \label{fig:attheedges}
\end{figure}

One potential pitfall with QRE lenses is that the combinators which
we define on them may not preserve this normal form. For example, the
composition $q' \circ q$ of QRE lenses $q$ and $q'$ may not be equivalent to
any quotient lens which has the canonical normal form of a bijective lens with
canonizers a the edges. Our main technical contribution in this paper is a
proof that QRE lenses are closed under left quotienting, right quotienting,
composition, and regular combinators. This proof will allow justify our
approach for synthesizing quotient lenses so that the programmer can simply
type

\begin{verbatim}
let bib_to_end : (lens in bibtex <=> endnot) 
= synth bibtex <=> endnote  using  {(bib_example, end_example)}
\end{verbatim}
\noindent to synthesize a quotient lens that maps between \verb!bibtex! and
\verb!endnote! QREs, and sends the equivalence class of \verb!bib_bexample! to
the equivalence class of \verb!end_example!.

In summary, our main contributions are:
\begin{enumerate}
\item We introduce a novel language of {\em Quotient Regular Expressions}
(QREs) that provide compact, convenient notation for a natural and useful
class of equivalence relations on regular languages (Section~\ref{QRE}).
\item We define a language of {\em QRE lenses}, a form of quotient lenses
whose types are given by QREs.  Our main technical contribution is a normal
form for QRE lenses and a proof that QRE lenses in normal form are closed
under left quotienting, right quotienting, composition, and regular
operators (Section~\ref{QRE-lenses}).
\item Using this normal form, we reduce the problem of {\em synthesizing}
QRE lenses from their QRE types and a set of examples to the previously studied
problem of synthesizing bijective lenses between regular languages 
(Section~\ref{synth}).
\item We extend the Boomerang {\em implementation} with QREs, QRE lens operators,
and QRE lens synthesis and demonstrate its applicability by using it to
synthesize QRE lenses between several real-world data formats from the
{\tt data.gov} database (Section~\ref{impl}).
\end{enumerate}
Sections~\ref{relwork} and~\ref{concl} discuss related and future work.

\section{Quotient Regular Expressions}
\label{QRE}

This section introduces Quotient Regular Expressions or QREs. QREs are regular
expressions augmented with syntax that lets them simultaneously express an
equivalence relation on the language described by the regular expression.

We have already encountered the \verb!project R -> s! QRE which sends all
elements of the language described by the regular expression $R$, and the

\noindent \verb!perm (q_1, ..., q_n) with q! QRE which sends all permutations of
the QREs $q_1, \ldots, q_n$ separated by the QRE $q$ to the canonical
QRE $q_1 \cdot q \cdot \ldots \cdot q \cdot q_n$.

Now consider a variant of the \bibtex{} to EndNote example transformation,
where, the only quotienting occurs in the author field, where the author's name
can have the last name followed by a comma and then the rest of the name, or
remain as before where the names are separated by a space.

For example, these two records should be considered equivalent:
\begin{verbatim}
@Book {conway,
  Author = "Conway, J. H.",
  Title = {Regular Algebra and Finite Machines},
}
\end{verbatim}
\begin{verbatim}
@Book {conway,
  Author = "J. H. Conway",
  Title = {Regular Algebra and Finite Machines},
}
\end{verbatim}

The equivalence described is one in which there is a bijection between 
the regular expressions \verb!comma_name! and \verb!space_name! given by,
\begin{verbatim}
let comma_name : regexp = name | (name . ", " . name . (" " . name)*)

let space_name : regexp = name | (name . " " . (name . wsp_to_space)* . name)

\end{verbatim}

\noindent with the lens \verb!comma_to_space! mapping between them given by 
\begin{verbatim}
let comma_to_space : (lens in space_name <=> comma_name) =
lens_swap 
(name . del " " . (ins " " . name . del " ")* ) (name . ins ", ") || name 
\end{verbatim}

The $\squash{R}{R'}{f}$ QRE is designed to make it easy to express such
equivalences easily. Specifically, given regular expressions $R$ and $R'$, and
a function $f : \mathcal{L}(R) \longrightarrow \mathcal{L}(R')$, the
$\squash{R}{R'}{f}$ QRE expresses the equivalence relation on $\mathcal{L}(R \;
R')$ which sends each element $r \in \mathcal{L}(R)$ to the canonical element
$f(r) \in \mathcal{L}(R')$, and sends each element $r' \in \mathcal{L}(R')$ to
itself:

\begin{verbatim}
let squash_author : canonizer =  
squash space_name -> comma_name using (get comma_to_space)

let author : canonizer = "author = \"" . squash_author . "\""
\end{verbatim}

In this example, the \verb!squash_author! QRE expresses the fact that the
\verb!space_name! and \verb!comma_name! representations of the authors' name
are equivalent, with the \verb!comma_name! representation chosen as the
canonical representation, and the function \verb!comma_to_space.get! giving
the canonizing function which converts data in the \verb!space_name! format
to its \verb!comma_name! representation.

The $\squash{R}{R'}{f}$ has the added advantage that if the transformation from
$R$ to $R'$ can be expressed by a bijective lens that is consistent with a set
of examples, then the programmer can synthesize the lens from $R$ to $R'$
because of our previous work where we demonstrated how to synthesize bijective
lenses from a pair of regular expressions and a set of input-output example
pairs:

\begin{verbatim}
let comma_to_space : (lens in space_name <=> comma_name) = 
synth space_name <=> comma_name using {("J. H. Conway", "Conway, J. H.")}
\end{verbatim}

The regular combinators for QREs i.e. $\cdot$ (concatenation), $|$ (union) and
$*$ (iteration) behave like the regular combinators for regular languages. For
instance, if the QRE for matching a \bibtex{} record is named
\verb!bibtex!, then the QRE for matching two records is 
\verb!bibtex . bibtex!, the QRE for matching one or two records is
\verb! bibtex | (bibtex . bibtex)! and the QRE for matching any number of QRE
records \verb!bibtex*!

The $\normalize{R}{R'}{f}$ expresses the equivalence relation which sends each
element in $\mathcal{L}(R)$ to its canonical representation $f(r) \in
\mathcal{L}(R')$. The equivalence relation defined by
$\normalize{R}{R'}{f}$ is thus the equivalence relation on
$\mathcal{L}(R)$ defined by the {\em fibres} of $f$ (i.e. $r \sim r'$ if and
only if $f(r) = f(r'))$. The canonizing function $f$ is required to be
surjective and idempotent.

The $\normalize{R}{R'}{f}$ QRE is the most general QRE in that for each QREs
$q$, there exist regular expressions $R, R'$ and a surjective, idempotent
function $f:\mathcal{L}(R) \longrightarrow \mathcal{L}(R')$ such that $q$ and
$\normalize{R}{R'}{f}$ each define the same equivalence relation on
$\mathcal{L}(R)$, with $\mathcal{L}(R')$ forming a complete set of
representatives for this equivalence relation. The $\normalize{R}{R'}{f}$
combinator is included so as to express equivalence relations which are
difficult to express, or which cannot be expressed, using the other
combinators. However, checking that the canonizing function $f$ is
surjective and idempotent is undecidable, thus we do not use the
$\normalize{R}{R'}{f}$ in practice. On the other hand, the
$\normalize{R}{R'}{f}$ combinator gives a sufficient condition for potential
QREs to be ``well-behaved'', particularly with respect to our strategy for
synthesizing quotient lenses which we shall introduce in Section~\ref{synth}.

While QREs express a broad class of equivalence relations on regular languages,
they do not express all the equivalence relations that can be expressed in
Boomerang, nor of course all the equivalence relations which cannot be
expressed using Boomerang canonizers. For instance, Boomerang canonizers can
map a regular language described by $R$ to a regular language described by
$S$, with $\mathcal{L}(S) \not \subseteq \mathcal{L}(R)$, whereas each QRE $q$
canonizes a regular language described by $R$ to regular subset
$\mathcal{L}(R') \subseteq \mathcal{L}(R)$ described by $R'$.

In summary each QRE $q$ enables us to express
\begin{enumerate}
  \item a regular expression $W(q)$ (the ``whole'' of $q$),
  \item an equivalence relation $\eqrel{q}$ on $\mathcal{L}(W(q))$,
  \item a regular expression $K(q)$ (the ``kernel'' of $q$)
  such that $\mathcal{L}(K(q))$ forms a complete set of representatives for
  $\eqrel{q}$, and
  \item a ``canonizing'' function $\canonizer(q):\mathcal{L}(W(q))
  \longrightarrow \mathcal{L}(K(q))$ which given any $w \in \mathcal{L}(W(q))$,
  computes $\canonizer(q)(w)$ as the unique $k$ in $\mathcal{L}(K(q))$ such that
  $k$ is equivalent to $w$ mod $\eqrel{q}$
  \end{enumerate}
  Observe that since $\canonizer(q)$ computes $\canonizer(q)(w)$ as the unique
  $k$ in $\mathcal{L}(K(q))$ such that $w$ is equivalent to $k$ mod $\eqrel{q}$,
  then the equivalence classes of $\eqrel{q}$ are the same as the fibres of
  $\canonizer(q)$.
\subsection{Syntax of QREs}
The language of Quotient Regular Expressions (QREs) is given by the following
grammar:
\begin{align*}
q := \; &R \sep R \mapsto s \sep \squash{R}{R'}{f} \sep
\perm{q_1, \ldots, q_n}{q} \;  | \; \normalize{R}{R'}{f}\\
&q' \circ q \sep q \cdot q' \sep (q \sep q') \sep q^*,
\end{align*}
where $R$ ranges over regular expressions, $f$ ranges over functions between
regular languages, and $s$ ranges over character strings.
  
\subsection{Semantics of QREs}
\subsubsection{Preliminaries}
Let $q, q'$ be QREs. When applying the regular combinators to QREs, we require
that if a string $s$ matches any of the regular expressions $W(q) \cdot W(q')$,
$W(q) \sep W(q')$, $W(q)^*$, $K(q) \cdot K(q')$,
$K(q) \sep K(q')$, $K(q)^*$, then $s$ matches that regular expression in
only one way. This unambiguity condition is called {\em strong unambiguity},
and is necessary, firstly because it ensures that the canonizing function of a
QRE is well-defined.

For example consider the QRE

\begin{verbatim}
let ambiguous : canonizer = "a"* . (project "a"* -> "a")
\end{verbatim}

\noindent The behaviour of \verb!ambiguous! is not-well defined since the string
\verb!"aaa"! can be canonized to any of \verb!"a", "aa", "aaa"! depending on how
\verb!"aaa"! is parsed. We also require that the regular combinators applied to
the kernels are unambiguous since the underlying lenses will end up operating
on the kernels, and these lenses impose the same restrictions for similar
reasons.

To this end, we say that regular expressions $R$ and $S$ are
\textit{unambiguosly concatenable}, written $R \cdot^! S$ if for all strings
$r, r' \in \mathcal{L}(R)$ and $s, s' \in \mathcal{L}(S)$, if $r \cdot s = r'
\cdot s'$, then $r = r'$ and $s = s'$. We say that a regular expression $R$ is
\textit{unambiguosly iterable}, written $R^{*!}$ if for all strings $r_1,
\ldots, r_m$ and $r'_1, \ldots, r'_n \in \mathcal{L}(R)$, if $r_1 \cdot \ldots
\cdot r_m = r'_1 \cdot \ldots \cdot r'_n$, then $m = n$ and $r_i = r'_i$.

We say that a regular expression $R$ is \textit{strongly unambiguous} if and
only if (1) $R = \varnothing$, or (2) $R = S_1 \cdot S_2$ with $S_1, S_2$
strongly unambiguous and $S_1 \cdot^! S_n$, or (3) $R = S_1 \sep S_2$ with
$S_1, S_2$ strongly unambiguous and $\mathcal{L}(S_1) \cap \mathcal{L}(S_2) =
\varnothing$, or (4) $R = S^*$ with $S$ strongly unambiguous and $S^{*!}$.

The semantics for QREs that formally define the whole language $W(q)$, the
kernel language $K(q)$, the equivalence relation $\eqrel{q}$ and the
canonizing function $\canonizer(q)$ are given in
Figures~\ref{fig:wk},~\ref{fig:relations} and~\ref{fig:canonizers}.

\begin{theorem}
If $q$ is a well formed QRE, then
\begin{enumerate}
  \item $W(q)$ and $K(q)$ are well defined regular expressions,
  \item  $\eqrel{q}$ is an equivalence relation on $\mathcal{L}(W(q))$,
  \item  $\mathcal{L}(K(q))$ forms a complete set of representatives for
  $\eqrel{q}$,
  \item $\canonizer(q):\mathcal{L}(W(q)) \longrightarrow \mathcal{L}(K(q))$ is a
  well-defined function, and
  \item  given any $w \in \mathcal{L}(W(q))$, $\canonizer(q)(w)$ is the unique
  $k$ in $\mathcal{L}(K(q))$ such that $k$ is equivalent to $w$ modulo
  $\eqrel{q}$.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{theorem}

\section{QRE Lenses}
\label{QRE-lenses} 
As we have seen, QREs express a broad class of equivalence relations
directly on regular languages.  QREs are therefore a good \textit{specification}
language for quotient lenses. In this section of the paper, we introduce
\textit{QRE Lenses}. QRE lenses are quotient lenses based on the Boomerang
quotient lens combinators, but which use QREs to describe their source and view
types.

Our approach in defining QRE lenses is as follows. Let $c, c'$ be QREs. Given a
bijection $\ell : K(c) \Leftrightarrow K(c')$, we may define a quotient lens $q
: W(c)/\eqrel{c} \Leftrightarrow W(c')/\eqrel{c'}$ by
\begin{equation}\label{normalform}
q.get = \ell \circ \canonizer(c) \text{ and } q.put = \ell^{-1} \circ
\canonizer(c'),
\end{equation}

\noindent One potential pitfall with QRE lenses is that the combinators which
we define on them may not preserve this normal form. For example, the
composition $q' \circ q$ of QRE lenses $q$ and $q'$ may not be equivalent to
any quotient lens which has the canonical normal form of a bijective lens with
canonizers a the edges. Consequently, in order to define quotient lenses, we
need to choose a class of bijections that has just the right properties with
respect to the quotient lens combinators. Our choice is to use the class of
\textit{bijective lenses}, a subset of the lenses expressible in Boomerang which
we identified and studied in our previous work~\cite{popl18}. Bijective lenses,
which we briefly discuss in the next subsection, possess the properties needed
to ensure that all QRE lenses have the normal form suggested in
\ref{normalform}.

\subsection{Bijective Lenses}
Define the set of \textit{bijective lenses} to be the set of bijections
between regular languages created from Boomerang lens combinators.
The syntax for the language of bijective lenses is given by
$$\ell := \mathit{id} \; (R) \sep const(s, s') \sep  swap(\ell,
\ell) \sep \ell \cdot \ell' \; |  \; (\ell \sep \ell') \sep \ell^* \;
| \; \ell \circ \ell',$$ where $R$ ranges over regular expressions and $s$
ranges over character strings.

The denotation of a lens $\ell$ is $\llbracket \ell \rrbracket \subseteq
\mathit{String} \times \mathit{String}$. If $(s_1, s_2) \in \llbracket \ell
\rrbracket$, then $\ell$ maps between $s_1$ and $s_2$.

\begin{align*}
\llbracket R \rrbracket &= \{(r, r) \sep r \in \mathcal{L}(R)\}\\
\llbracket swap(\ell, \ell') \rrbracket &= \{(s \cdot t, t' \cdot s') \sep
(s, s') \in \llbracket \ell \rrbracket \text{ and } (t, t') \in \llbracket
\ell' \rrbracket\}\\
\llbracket \ell \cdot \ell' \rrbracket &= \{(s \cdot t, s' \cdot t) \sep
(s, s') \in \llbracket \ell \rrbracket \text{ and } (t, t') \in \llbracket
\ell' \rrbracket\}\\
\llbracket \ell \sep \ell' \rrbracket &= \{(s \cdot t) \sep
(s, t) \in \llbracket \ell \rrbracket \text{ or } (s, t) \in \llbracket
\ell' \rrbracket\}\\
\llbracket \ell^* \rrbracket &= \{(s_1 \cdot \ldots \cdot s_n, t_1 \cdot \ldots
\cdot t_n) \sep (s_i, t_i) \in \llbracket \ell \rrbracket \text{ for } 1
\leq i \leq n\}
\end{align*}

The $\mathit{const}(s, t)$ lens replaces the string $s$ with $t$ in the source
data in the forward direction, and $t$ with $s$ in the view data in the backward
direction. $\mathit{id}(R)$ applies the identity function to the source and view
in $\mathcal{L}(R)$ in both directions. The composition lens $\ell' \circ \ell$
applies $\ell$ followed by then $\ell'$ to the source in the forward direction,
and applies $\ell'$ followed by $\ell$ to the view in the backward direction.
The lens $\ell \cdot \ell'$ first splits the string $s$ into $s_1$ and $s_2$,
applies $\ell$ and $\ell'$ to $s_1$ and $s_2$ to get $t_1$ and $t_2$
respectively, then concatenates $t_1$ and $t_2$ and returns $t_1 \cdot t_2$ as
the final result in the forward direction. $\ell \cdot \ell'$ operates
similarly in the backward direction, but with $s, s_1$ and $s_2$ substituted
for $t, t_1$ and $t_2$. The $\mathit{swap} \; (\ell, \ell')$ lens operates
like $\ell \cdot \ell'$, except that it swaps $t_1$ and $t_2$ before
concatenating the two for a final result of $t_2 \cdot t_1$ in the forward
direction. In the backward direction, $\mathit{swap}(\ell, \ell')$ first undoes
the swap, then proceeds as expected. The $\ell \; | \; \ell'$ lens
chooses to apply $\ell$ or $\ell'$ depending on whether the source
(resp. view) data is matched by $\ell$ or $\ell'$ in the forward (resp.
backward direction. The $\ell^*$ lens splits the string $s$ into strings $s_1,
\ldots, s_n$, applies $\ell$ to each $s_i$ to get $t_i$, and then concatenates
each of the $t_i$'s for a final result of $t_1 \cdot \ldots \cdot t_n$ in the
forward direction. $\ell^*$ operates similarly in the backward direction, but
with $s, s_i$ substituted for $t, t_i$.

Each bijective lens $\ell$ has a type $\ell : R \Leftrightarrow S$ where $R$ and
$S$ are regular expressions. If $\ell : R \Leftrightarrow S$, then the source
type of $\ell$ is $\mathcal{L}(R)$ and the view type of $\ell$ is
$\mathcal{L}(S)$. Interestingly, with the bijective lens type system, a lens
$\ell : R \Leftrightarrow S$ can also be considered to be of type $\ell : R'
\Leftrightarrow S'$ provided that $R$ (resp. $S$) can be proven to be
equivalent to $R'$ (resp. $S$) from the star-semiring axioms. The typing rules
for bijective lenses are given in Figure~\ref{fig:lensrules}.

\subsection{Syntax of QRE Lenses}
Having given a brief overview of the class of bijective lenses, we now introduce
the class of QRE lenses, whose language is given by following grammar:
$$ q := \mathit{lift}(\ell) \sep \mathit{lquot}(q, \ell) \sep
\mathit{rquot}(\ell, q) \sep q \cdot q' \sep (q \sep q') \sep q^* \sep q \circ q',$$
where $\ell$ ranges over bijective lenses.

The QRE lens combinators are inspired by the Boomerang lens combinators of the
same name. The $\mathit{lift}(\ell)$ quotient lens enables a bijective lens
$\ell$ to be considered a quotient lens where the equivalence relation applied
to the source and view types is the equality relation, and the regular
combinators $\cdot \; * \; |$ on QRE lenses exhibit the expected behaviour,
with the caveat that the regular expressions used by these lenses are strongly
unambiguous.

The more interesting combinators are the $\mathit{lquot}$ and $\mathit{rquot}$
combinators. The $\mathit{lquot}(c, q)$ combinator takes a quotient lens $q$ and
quotients the source data using $c$, assuming that the source data forms a
complete set of representatives for the equivalence relation $\eqrel{c}$. The
$\mathit{lquot}(q, c)$ combinator does the same but on the view data. For
example, recall that in the \bibtex{} to EndNote transformation, we had the QREs
\verb!bibtex! and \verb!endnote! describing the \bibtex{} and EndNote records
respectively, and the bijective lens \verb!bib_to_end! that maps between
\verb!bibtex! and \verb!endnote!. The quotient lens which maps between
\verb!bibtex! and \verb!endnote! is given by the QRE lens

\begin{verbatim}
let bib_to_end_q : (lens in bibtex <=> endnote) = 
rquot (lquot (bibtex, bib_to_end), endnote)
 \end{verbatim} 
 
The difference between QRE lenses and Boomerang quotient lenses lies in the
typing judgements. More concretely, each QRE lens $q$ has a type $q : c
\Leftrightarrow c'$ where $c, c'$ are QREs. In contrast, the approach used to
type quotient lenses in Boomerang is to classify equivalences according to
whether they are or are not the equality relation. This type system is based on
two observations: first, that most quotient lenses originate as lifted basic
lenses, and therefore have types whose equivalence relations are both equality;
and second, that equality is preserved by many of the quotient lens
combinators. Foster et al also discuss a second possible approach to typing
quotient lenses, where equivalence relations are represented by rational
functions that induce them. While this second approach is more refined than the
first, Boomerang favours the first approach since the second appears to be too
expensive to be useful in practice~\cite{quotientlenses}.

\subsection{Semantics of QRE Lenses}
The denotation $\llbracket q \rrbracket$ of a QRE lens $q:c \Leftrightarrow c'$
is a quotient lens $\llbracket q \rrbracket : W(c)/{\eqrel{c}}
\Longleftrightarrow W(c')/{\eqrel{c'}}$. The typing rules and denotation of QRE
lenses are given in Figure~\ref{fig:qlenssemantics}. The following theorem
confirms that QRE lenses exhibit the intended behaviour.

\begin{theorem}
If there is a derivation $q:c \Leftrightarrow c'$ then
$\llbracket q \rrbracket : W(c)/{\eqrel{c}} \Leftrightarrow
W(c')/{\eqrel{c'}}$ is a well-defined quotient lens.

\subsection{Normal Forms of QRE Lenses}
Recall that our approach in defining QRE lenses is to have each QRE lens $q: c
\Leftrightarrow c'$ be such that 
\begin{align*}
\llbracket q \rrbracket.get &= \ell \circ \canonizer(c)\\
\llbracket q \rrbracket.put &= \ell^{-1} \circ
\canonizer(c')
\end{align*}
for some bijective lens $\ell$. We now provide a proof that all QRE lenses are
of this form.\bcp{Maybe some cases of the proof can be elided in the short
  version?} 
\begin{theorem}\label{normal form}
If there is a derivation $q : c \Leftrightarrow c'$, then there exists a
bijective lens $\ell : K(c) \Leftrightarrow K(c')$ such that
\begin{align*}
\llbracket q \rrbracket.get &= \llbracket \ell \rrbracket\circ \canonizer(c)\\
\llbracket q \rrbracket.put &= \llbracket \ell \rrbracket^{-1} \circ
\canonizer(c')
\end{align*}
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
Assume that $q : c \Leftrightarrow c'$. We proceed by induction over the
derivation $q : c \Leftrightarrow c'$.
\begin{enumerate}
  \item
  $\mathit{lift}(\ell): R/\mathit{id}(R) \Leftrightarrow S/\mathit{id}(S)$ where
  $\ell :
  R \Leftrightarrow S$. Then
  \begin{align*}
  \llbracket \mathit{lift}(\ell) \rrbracket.get &=  \llbracket \ell \rrbracket
  = \llbracket \ell \rrbracket \circ id_{\mathcal{L}(R)} =
  \llbracket \ell \rrbracket \circ \canonizer(\mathit{id}(R)), \text{ and }\\
  \llbracket \mathit{lift}(\ell) \rrbracket.put &= \llbracket \ell
  \rrbracket^{-1} = \llbracket \ell \rrbracket^{-1} \circ id_{\mathcal{L}(S)} =
  \llbracket \ell \rrbracket^{-1} \circ \canonizer(id(S))
  \end{align*}
  \item
  $\mathit{lquot}(c, q'): c' \circ c \Leftrightarrow c''$ where $q' : c' 
  \Leftrightarrow c''$, $c$ is well formed and $K(c) = W(c')$. Then
\begin{align*}
  \llbracket q \rrbracket.get  &= \llbracket q'
  \rrbracket.get \circ \canonizer(c)\\
  \llbracket q \rrbracket.put &= \llbracket q' \rrbracket.put
  \end{align*}
  By the induction hypothesis, there exists a bijective lens $\ell :
  K(c') \Leftrightarrow K(c'')$ such that 
  \begin{align*}
\llbracket q' \rrbracket.get &= \llbracket \ell \rrbracket \circ \canonizer(c')\\
\llbracket q' \rrbracket.put &= \llbracket \ell \rrbracket^{-1} \circ
Canonize(c'')
\end{align*}
Consequently
\begin{align*}
  \llbracket q \rrbracket.get  &= (\llbracket \ell \rrbracket \circ
  \canonizer(c')) \circ \canonizer(c) = \llbracket \ell \rrbracket \circ
  (\canonizer(c' \circ c))\\
  \llbracket q \rrbracket.put &= \llbracket \ell \rrbracket^{-1} \circ
  Canonize(c'')
  \end{align*}

  \item
  $\mathit{rquot}(q', c''):c \Leftrightarrow c'' \circ c'$ where $q' : c \Leftrightarrow
  c'$, $c''$ is well formed and $K(c'') = W(c')$. Proceed as in the previous
  case.
\item
$q_2 \circ q_1: c \Leftrightarrow c''$ where $q_1 : c \Leftrightarrow c'$ and
$q_2 : c' \Leftrightarrow c''$. Then
  \begin{align*}
  \llbracket q \rrbracket.get &= \llbracket q_2 \rrbracket.get\circ \llbracket
  q_1 \rrbracket.get, \text{ and }\\
  \llbracket q \rrbracket.put &= \llbracket q_1 \rrbracket.put \circ \llbracket
  q_2 \rrbracket.put
  \end{align*}
  By the induction hypothesis, there exist bijective lenses
  $\ell_1 :
  K(c) \Leftrightarrow K(c')$ and $\ell_2 : K(c') \Leftrightarrow K(c'')$ such
  that
  \begin{align*}
\llbracket q_1 \rrbracket.get &= \llbracket \ell_1 \rrbracket \circ
\canonizer(c)\\
\llbracket q_1 \rrbracket.put &= {\llbracket \ell_1 \rrbracket}^{-1} \circ
\canonizer(c')
\end{align*}
and
\begin{align*}
\llbracket q_2 \rrbracket.get &= \llbracket \ell_2 \rrbracket \circ
Canonize(c')\\
\llbracket q_2 \rrbracket.put &= {\llbracket \ell_2 \rrbracket}^{-1} \circ
Canonize(c'')
\end{align*}
Consequently,
\begin{align*}
\llbracket q_2 \rrbracket.get \circ \llbracket q_1 \rrbracket.get &=
(\llbracket \ell_2 \rrbracket \circ \canonizer(c')) \circ (\llbracket \ell_1
\rrbracket \circ \canonizer(c))\\
&= \llbracket \ell_2 \rrbracket \circ (\canonizer(c') \circ \llbracket \ell_1
\rrbracket) \circ \canonizer(c)\\
&= (\llbracket \ell_2 \rrbracket \circ \llbracket \ell_1 \rrbracket) \circ
\canonizer(c)\\
&= \llbracket \ell_2  \circ  \ell_1 \rrbracket \circ
\canonizer(c)
\end{align*} 
A similar argument shows that 
$$\llbracket q_1 \rrbracket.put \circ \llbracket q_2 \rrbracket.put =
\llbracket \ell_2  \circ  \ell_1 \rrbracket^{-1} \circ
\canonizer(c)$$
\item  
${q'}^* : c^* \Leftrightarrow {c'}^*$ where $q' : c \Leftrightarrow c'$,
$W(c)^{*!}$ and $W(c')^{*!}$ and $K(c)^{*!}$ and $K(c')^{*!}$. Then
  \begin{align*}
  \llbracket {q'}^* \rrbracket.get &= (\llbracket q' \rrbracket.get)^*, \text{
  and }\\
  \llbracket {q'}^* \rrbracket.put &= (\llbracket q' \rrbracket.put)^*
  \end{align*}
  By the induction hypothesis there exists a bijective lens $\ell : K(c)
  \Leftrightarrow K(c')$ such that 
   that
  \begin{align*}
\llbracket q' \rrbracket.get &= \llbracket \ell \rrbracket \circ
\canonizer(c)\\
\llbracket q' \rrbracket.put &= {\llbracket \ell \rrbracket}^{-1} \circ
\canonizer(c')
\end{align*}
Consequentlty
\begin{align*}
\llbracket {q'}^* \rrbracket.get &= (\llbracket \ell \rrbracket \circ
\canonizer(c))^* = \llbracket \ell \rrbracket^* \circ
\canonizer(c)^* = \llbracket \ell^* \rrbracket \circ
\canonizer(c^*)\\
\llbracket {q'}^* \rrbracket.put &= (\llbracket \ell \rrbracket^{-1} \circ
\canonizer(c'))^* = (\llbracket \ell \rrbracket^{-1})^* \circ
\canonizer(c')^* = \llbracket \ell^* \rrbracket^{-1} \circ
\canonizer(c'^*)\\
\end{align*}
\item
  $q_1 \cdot q_2: c_1 \cdot c_2 \Leftrightarrow d_1 \cdot d_2$, where $q_1 : c_1
  \Leftrightarrow d_1 $,  $q_2 : c_2 \Leftrightarrow d_2$, $W(c_1)
  \cdot^! W(c_2)$, $K(c_1) \cdot^! K(c_2)$, $W(d_1) \cdot^! W(d_2)$ and $
  K(d_1) \cdot^! K(d_2)$. Then
  \begin{align*}
  \llbracket q \rrbracket.get &= \llbracket q_1 \rrbracket.get \cdot \llbracket
  q_2 \rrbracket.get, \text{ and }\\
  \llbracket q \rrbracket.put &= \llbracket q_1 \rrbracket.put \cdot \llbracket
  q_2 \rrbracket.put
  \end{align*}
By the induction hypothesis, there exist bijective lenses $\ell_1 : K(c_1)
\Leftrightarrow K(d_1)$ and $\ell_2 : K(c_2) \Leftrightarrow K(d_2)$ such that
\begin{align*}
\llbracket q_1 \rrbracket.get &= \llbracket \ell_1 \rrbracket \circ
\canonizer(c_1)\\
\llbracket q_1 \rrbracket.put &= {\llbracket \ell_1 \rrbracket}^{-1} \circ
\canonizer(d_1)
\end{align*}
and
\begin{align*}
\llbracket q_2 \rrbracket.get &= \llbracket \ell_2 \rrbracket \circ
\canonizer(c_2)\\
\llbracket q_2 \rrbracket.put &= {\llbracket \ell_2 \rrbracket}^{-1} \circ
\canonizer(d_2)
\end{align*}
Consequently,
\begin{align*}
  \llbracket q \rrbracket.get &= (\llbracket \ell_1 \rrbracket \circ
\canonizer(c_1)) \cdot  (\llbracket \ell_2 \rrbracket \circ
\canonizer(c_2))\\
&= (\llbracket \ell_1 \rrbracket \cdot \llbracket \ell_2
\rrbracket) \circ (\canonizer(c_1) \cdot \canonizer(c_2))\\
&= \llbracket \ell_1 \cdot  \ell_2 \rrbracket \circ \canonizer(c_1 \cdot c_2)
\end{align*}
Similarly
$$
  \llbracket q \rrbracket.put = \llbracket \ell_1 \cdot  \ell_2 \rrbracket^{-1}
  \circ \canonizer(d_1 \cdot d_2) $$
  \item
  $q = q_1 \sep q_2$ where $q_1 : c_1 \Leftrightarrow d_1 $, $q_2 : c_2
  \Leftrightarrow d_2$, $\mathcal{L}(W(c_1)) \cap \mathcal{L}(W(c_2)) =
  \varnothing$ and $\mathcal{L}(W(d_1)) \cap \mathcal{L}(W(d_2)) = \varnothing$.
  Then
  $$
  \llbracket q_1 \sep q_2 \rrbracket.get(s) = 
  \begin{cases}
  \llbracket q_1 \rrbracket.get (s) & \text{if } s \in \mathcal{L}(W(c_1))\\
  \llbracket q_2 \rrbracket.get (s) & \text{if } s \in \mathcal{L}(W(c_2))\\
  \end{cases}$$
  $$\llbracket q_1 \sep q_2 \rrbracket.put(s) = 
  \begin{cases}
  \llbracket q_1 \rrbracket.put (s) & \text{if } s \in \mathcal{L}(W(d_1))\\
  \llbracket q_2 \rrbracket.put (s) & \text{if } s \in \mathcal{L}(W(d_2))\\
  \end{cases}
  $$
By the induction hypothesis, there exist bijective lenses $\ell_1 : K(c_1)
\Leftrightarrow K(d_1)$ and $\ell_2 : K(c_2) \Leftrightarrow K(d_2)$ such that
\begin{align*}
\llbracket q_1 \rrbracket.get &= \llbracket \ell_1 \rrbracket \circ
\canonizer(c_1)\\
\llbracket q_1 \rrbracket.put &= {\llbracket \ell_1 \rrbracket}^{-1} \circ
\canonizer(d_1)
\end{align*}
and
\begin{align*}
\llbracket q_2 \rrbracket.get &= \llbracket \ell_2 \rrbracket \circ
\canonizer(c_2)\\
\llbracket q_2 \rrbracket.put &= {\llbracket \ell_2 \rrbracket}^{-1} \circ
\canonizer(d_2)
\end{align*}
Consequently,
$$
  \llbracket q_1 \sep q_2 \rrbracket.get(s) = 
  \begin{cases}
  \llbracket \ell_1 \rrbracket \circ
\canonizer(c_1) (s) & \text{if } s \in \mathcal{L}(W(c_1))\\
  \llbracket \ell_2 \rrbracket \circ
\canonizer(c_2) (s) & \text{if } s \in \mathcal{L}(W(c_2)),\\
  \end{cases}$$
  so $\llbracket q_1 \sep q_2 \rrbracket.get = \llbracket \ell_1 \sep
  \ell_2 \rrbracket \circ \canonizer(c_1 \sep c_2)$. A similar argument shows
  that $\llbracket q_1 \sep q_2 \rrbracket.put = \llbracket \ell_1 \sep
  \ell_2 \rrbracket^{-1} \circ \canonizer(d_1 \sep d_2)$.\\
  This completes the proof.
\end{enumerate}
\end{proof}

\section{Synthesizing QRE Lenses}
\label{synth}
Our goal in this section is to demonstrate how to synthesize a quotient lens
$q: c \Leftrightarrow c'$ from the QREs $c, c'$ and a set of input-output pairs
$\{(x_1, y_1), \ldots, (x_n, y_n)\}$ where the $x_i$'s are in $W(c)$ and the
$y_i$'s are in $W(c')$.

We have shown in Theorem~\ref{normal form} that if there is a derivation $q : c
\Leftrightarrow c'$ of a QRE lens, then there exists a bijective lens $\ell :
K(c) \Leftrightarrow K(c')$ such that
\begin{align*}
\llbracket q \rrbracket.get &= \llbracket \ell \rrbracket\circ \canonizer(c)\\
\llbracket q \rrbracket.put &= \llbracket \ell \rrbracket^{-1} \circ
\canonizer(c')
\end{align*}

Now since the $x_i$'s are in $W(c)$ and the $y_i$'s are in $W(c')$, then

\noindent ${x_i}' = \canonizer(c)(x_i)$ is in $K(c)$ and ${y_i}' =
\canonizer(c')(y_i)$ is in $K(c')$, hence in order to synthesize the desired
quotient lens $q$ it suffices to synthesize a bijective lens $l : K(c)
\Leftrightarrow K(c')$ that is consistent with the canonized examples
$\{({x_1}', {y_1}'), \ldots, ({x_n}', {y_n}')\}$

In our previous work, we showed that given regular expressions $R, S$ and a set
of input-output pairs $\{(r_1, s_1), \ldots, (r_n, s_n)\}$, if there is a
derivation $\ell : R \Leftrightarrow S$ of a bijective lens that maps $r_i$ to
$s_i$ in the forward direction and $s_i$ to $r_i$ in the backward direction,
then there is an algorithm that computes a bijective lens $\ell' : R'
\Leftrightarrow S'$ such that $R \equiv R'$, $S \equiv S'$, $\ell'$ maps $r_i$
to $s_i$ in the forward direction and $s_i$ to $r_i$ in the backward direction,
and $\llbracket \ell \rrbracket = \llbracket \ell' \rrbracket$~\cite{popl18}.

This implies that if there is a derivation $q : c \Leftrightarrow
c'$ of a QRE lens as well as a derivation $\ell : K(c) \Leftrightarrow K(c')$
that is consistent with the canonized examples $\{({x_1}', {y_1}'),
\ldots, ({x_n}', {y_n}')\}$, then we can synthesize a quotient lens $q$ of
type $c \Leftrightarrow c'$ that is consistent with $\{({x_1}', {y_1}'),
\ldots, ({x_n}', {y_n}')\}$.

More specifically, in order to synthesize a quotient lens $q: c \Leftrightarrow
c'$, that is consistent with the examples $\{(x_1, y_1), \ldots, (x_n, y_n)\}$
 it suffices to perform the following procedure:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item
  Compute $K(c)$, $K(c')$,
  \item
  compute $\{({x_1}', {y_1}'), \ldots, ({x_n}', {y_n}')\}$ where ${x_i}' =
  \canonizer(c)(x_i)$ and ${y_i}' = \canonizer(c')(y_i)$,
  \item
    synthesize a bijective lens $\ell : K(c) \Leftrightarrow K(c')$ that is
    consistent with the examples $\{({x_1}', {y_1}'), \ldots, ({x_n}',
    {y_n}')\}$
  \item 
  return $q = \mathit{rquot}(\mathit{lquot}(c, \ell), c') : c \Leftrightarrow
  c'$
\end{enumerate}
As an example, recall that
in the \bibtex{} to EndNote transformation we had the QREs \verb!bibtex! and \verb!endnote! describing a \bibtex{} record and an
Endnote record respectively. We also had the example pair 
\verb!(bib_example , end_example)! where

\begin{verbatim}
bib_example = 
"@Book {conway,
  Author = \"J. H. Conway\",
  Title = {Regular Algebra and Finite Machines},
}"
\end{verbatim}

\noindent and

\begin{verbatim}
end_example = 
"%0 Book
%T Regular Algebra and Finite Machines
%A J. H. Conway
%F conway"
\end{verbatim}

Since the transformation between the kernel of \verb!bibtex! and the kernel of
\verb!endnote! that maps \verb!bib_example! to \verb!end_example! can be
expressed by a bijective lens, it suffices to type the expression

\begin{verbatim}
let bib_to_end : (lens in bibtex <=> endnot) 
= synth bibtex <=> endnote  using  {(bib_example, end_example)}
\end{verbatim}

\section{Implementation and Evaluation}
\label{impl}


We have integrated QREs and quotient lens synthesis into Boomerang with an
additional \afm{loc} lines of OCaml code. 

All evaluations were performed on a 2.5 GHz Intel Core i7 processor with 16 GB
of 1600 MHz DDR3 running macOS Sierra.

Our evaluations serve to answer the following questions:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Does synthesizing quotient lenses from QREs permit for an easier
  development process than existing approaches.

\item Are QREs sufficiently expressive that more lenses can be synthesized
  without modifications to the format. 

\item Is our synthesis algorithm competitive with existing lens synthesis
  tools.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Benchmark Suite Construction} 
Our benchmarks were constructed from two sources:
\begin{enumerate}
\item \afm{39} of our benchmarks were derived from the Optician system.  These
  benchmarks were a combination of custom benchmarks, benchmarks derived from
  FlashFill, and benchmarks derived from Augeas.  Many of the formats mapped
  between had to be modified to work with the bijectivity constraints
  Optician required.  Commonly, one format had whitespace where the other did
  not allow for whitespace.  To address the bijectivity issues surrounding this,
  we added whitespace to the format that typically did not have whitespace.  We
  were able to remove these alterations in adopting these benchmarks to our
  system.

\item \afm{8} of our benchmarks were derived from data.gov.  Data.gov contains
  many transformations between formats.  In addition to the formats previously
  adopted for Optician, we synthesized transformers between these formats.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Easing the Development Process}

To test if our tool eases the development process, we compare the following
number of AST nodes.
%
\begin{itemize}
\item[\QRESize{}] \QRESize{} is the number of AST nodes in the QRE
  specifications involved in QRE lens synthesis task.
\item[\CanonizerAndSpecSize{}] \CanonizerAndSpecSize{} is the number of
  AST nodes in $W(q)$ summed with the number of AST nodes in $\canonizer(q)$,
  for each QRE used in QRE lens synthesis task.
\item[\LensAndSpecSize{}] \LensAndSpecSize{} is the number of AST nodes
  in $W(q)$ summed with the number of AST nodes in the synthesized QRE lens.
\end{itemize}

The value of \QRESize{} represents the difficulty in writing our benchmarks.

The value of \CanonizerAndSpecSize{} represents the difficulty in writing our
benchmarks without QREs.  This is only an approximation, as both $W(q)$ and
$\canonizer(q)$ are automatically generated from the QRE.  In our
experience, these automatically generated regular expressions and canonizers are
the ones we would naturally write.

The value of \LensAndSpecSize{} represents the difficulty in writing our benchmarks
with neither QREs nor synthesis.  This is also an approximation, as $W(q)$ and
$\canonizer(q)$ and the bijective lens are all automatically generated.
We have found that the generated bijective lens is fairly similar in size to the
one we would manually write, though it is typically less modular.

Figure~\ref{?} shows the number of benchmarks written with at most a given
number of AST nodes.  We found that \QRESize{} was consistently smaller than
\CanonizerAndSpecSize{} and \LensAndSpecSize{}, demonstrating that introducing
QREs saves programmers programming effort compared to both Optician and basic
Boomerang.

\subsection{Increase of Expressivity}

Optician was only able to synthesize fully bijective data transformations.
\Name loosens that restriction, and is able to synthesize data which is
bijective when put in canonical form.
To determine the increase of expressivity, we analyzed:
\begin{enumerate}
\item How many data formats in Optician's benchmark suite required modifications
  to be bijective.
\item How many data formats in Optician's benchmark suite required modifications
  to be bijective when put in canonical form.
\end{enumerate}

We found that 10 of Opticians 39 benchmarks required modifications to be
bijective. We found that 4 of Optician's 39
benchmarks required modifications to be in bijective correspondence when in
canonical form.  Furthermore, we found that all of the data.gov examples
required no modifications to be in canonical form.  While we did not put the
data.gov examples into a form suitable for Optician, we found only 4 of
the 8 data.gov examples did not require canonization, so making suitable
for Optician would have required a modification of 4 of the data.gov
formats.

\subsection{Competitive Performance}

While we expanded on the Optician system, we found it important to validate
performance did not degrade in this expansion.  To validate this, we tested:
\begin{itemize}
\item[\OpticianRuntime{}] Optician runs on its own benchmarks.
\item[\SystemOnOptician{}] \Name{} runs on Optician's benchmarks.
\item[\SystemOnBenchmarks{}] \Name{} runs on its own benchmarks.
\end{itemize}

We summarize the results of these experiments in Figure~\ref{?}.  \Name{} was
able to synthesize all of Optician's benchmarks at a speed competitive with
Optician.  Furthermore, adopting these tasks to use QREs actually sped up
tasks!  After canonization, the regular expressions sent to synthesis are
\emph{smaller} than before canonization - making the bijective lens synthesis
portion of these tasks easier.

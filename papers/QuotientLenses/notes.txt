- Title options:
   * Synthesizing Quotient Lenses
   * Synthesizable Quotient Lenses?
   * QRE 

- Mention that not all quotient lenses are expressible as QRE's.

  (or at least that there are differences w.r.t. expressiveness due to the
  treatment of squash, which requires that the canonizer yield a value in the
  same language)

- Add a 5th contribution bullet:
  We assess the usabibility of the QRE synthesis via a case study in which we selected several data formats used by data.gov and synthesize lenses between them.

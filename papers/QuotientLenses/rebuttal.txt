Thank you for the review and the suggestions for improvement.

The main comment that is critical of our work is that it is a small increment
over previous work. In our view, our paper presents two new methods which can be
applied in a broad variety of situations. 

First, our quotient regular expressions (QREs) are the first innovation that we
know of that can be used to define a broad class of equivalence relations on 
regular languages by simply adding  annotations to ordinary regular expressions.
By choosing an appropriate set of QRE combinators, one may specialize QREs to a 
specific application, hence the claim that QREs are widely applicable. 

Secondly, in our work, we show how to adapt an existing synthesis algorithm to 
solve a more complicated synthesis task; in order for us to prove a completeness
algorithm for the enhanced synthesis algorithm we had to prove the compositionality
theorem. This method is likely to be applicable in other situations; for instance
one may be able to define a synthesis algorithm for secure lenses by applying
similar techniques.

For these two reasons, we believe that our work present a significant advance in
the area of synthesis of bidirectional programming.

Another major point raised by the reviewer was the lack of compositionality in 
the construction of QREs, since the Â· and | combinators cannot be used to combine
arbitrary expressions due to the strong unambiguity constraint. Indeed this
constraint is an issue in practice, though many currently existing systems also
impose this same constraint. What QRE lens synthesis does is that it pushes all
the complexity to the "edges"; if one were to write canonizers as well as lenses
by hand, then the unambiguity constraints occur both in the canonizers as well
as on the lenses.

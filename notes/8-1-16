OH GOD THE OUTPUT IS BAD
MAKE IT SO LENSES CAN TAKE IN FILES, NOT JUST RANDOM EXAMPLES
benchmark suite of lenses & tests that it's CORRECT, not bogus
test examples that AREN'T given in inputs
how do we generate a READABLE lens
pp make better
need more tests!!!
randomly sample, and choose some additional files
add in min, max, avg # of examples
scrap your boilerplate paper
series of papers
simon peyton jones
library of combinators to traverse tree-like dss

look at boomerang lenses, are they comprehensible, if so why?
common subexpression elimination / common sublens identification
pretty print out with named sublenses as pieces, provide
compositional appearance to user
find similar solutions, show its true we can transform more
complicated things than in Sumit's work
powershell thing with system log files
sumit oopsla paper, provanof(?) guy
windows powershell(?!)

for next work...
clean up the -OUTPUT
MAKE LENSES
Some weaker form of completeness?
complete w.r.t. subset of kleene axioms
    semiring axioms / semirings + xyz
better to have SOME statement we can have as a basis
design not ad hoc, principle to this dnf form architecture
shows bound on scope

Whitespace / quotient lenses
    can we insert things
    grammar over whitespace
    READ THAT PAPER
    chapter in nate's thesis?
    chapter in old TA's thesis?
    lenses many papers in general
        1-3 per week depending on business
        what ideas can i borrow / apply
        what do they FAIL at that maybe synthesis can help or not even synthesis
        find the man behind curtain in papers

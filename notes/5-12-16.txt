We went through what was up on the repo
Looked at Regular Expressions
	- Use mathit for non-ugly math

Looked at Lenses
	- We have regex variables currently, we should add lens variables
	- Semantics as relations with theorem works well
	- Semantics as a function on the typing might work better
		- Try it out, see which is prettier, go with that

Looked at DNF Lenses
	- Introduce using ... format
	- At start of proofs, introduct alternative format
	- Look at OTT bar syntax, see what looks better
		- Not a conceptually difficult thing, most important is what
		  looks best
	- Soundness proof sketch seems good, time to finish latexing

Looked at examples
	- Good that I started writing up more examples, the plan for 1 a day
	  seems like a good strategy for getting a large test bed
	- There's some dinosaur syntax, now that I built up a slightly
	  better parser, clean that stuff out
	- I WANT REGEX FUNCTIONS
		- Look at boomerang stuff, maybe build a bridge between the
		  two
		- Dont spend too much time forcing the usage
	- Eventually overall integration with boomerang, maybe a
	  reimplementation
	- PPX Ocaml syntax extension is really cool
	- jane street libraries use
	- but dont spend too much time beautifying that stuff

TODOS:
Final touches on some syntax (lens vars, etc)
Finish latexing the soundness proof
Clean up some of the bad typesetting
Keep writing tests

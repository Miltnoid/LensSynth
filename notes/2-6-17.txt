  General Approach: Induction to make a normal form
  What is our normal form?
    We can view this pictorially
    Bijective Lenses look like this:

       ____________________________
       |                          |
      R|                          |S
       |                          |
       ----------------------------

    Canonizers look like this:

       |\
       |  \
       |    \
       |    |
      R|    |R'
       |    |
       |    /
       |  /
       |/

    Our normal form would look like this:

       |\
       |  \                        /|
       |    \____________________/  |
       |    |                    |  |
      R|    |R'                S'|  |S
       |    |                    |  |
       |    /--------------------\  |
       |  /                        \|
       |/

    So a bijective lens, with canonizers at the edges

  What would the proof look like?
    Combine the canonized form based on the typing of the noncanonized lens
      Say we have l1;l2, when we apply the IH, we get something like

       |\                             /|
       |  \           /|\           /  |
       |    \_______/  |  \_______/    |
       |    |       |  |  |       |    |
       |    |       |  |  |       |    |
       |    |       |  |  |       |    |
       |    /-------\  |  /-------\    |
       |  /           \|/           \  |
       |/                             \|

      And the complication becomes, how do we take away those central
       canonizers?
    Moving from this normal form to the QRE form probably wouldn't be that hard

      More of the same
    Solomon
      Formalize
        Some amount of syntax given for normalized / non-normalized form
        Formalize typing rules
      Try composition on easier cases
        Maybe consider a case where canonizer is only Singleton(R,s) and see if
         its easy

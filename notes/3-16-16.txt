We went over my proposed deduction rules.

Potential Issues:
With 1 regex given:
Splitting up right side examples into clauses
Splitting up right side examples into atoms

With 2 regex given:
Choosing which clauses go to which

With both:
Choosing which atoms go to which
When to split up a star
Proving Completeness

Potential Resolutions:
Use knowledge of where identities must occur to help prune search space

Moving forward:
Implement!
Work on completeness too

Minimum Description Length:

This is a sum of 2 components:
CT(T) + E(CD((d1,d2)|T))
where CT(T) is the cost of transferring how the data is encoded
  and CD((d1,d2)|T) is the information content that is lost going from one side
  to the other, for data on the left d1, and data on the right d2.

The average cost of storing data is inductively defined on the symmetric lens.
The cost of transferring how the data is encoded is information content of the
choices made during the expansion phase.

Search on increasing CT(T) until CT(T) is larger than the smallest
CT(T0) + E(CD(d|T0)).  Return that smallest T0.

Decided to push it back, now what?

More time -> More examples
Could we also do decideability?
    Less cool than completeness and usefulness, maybe cherry on top
Relax bijectivity
    Bijection up to quotient
    How does a user give quotient, do we infer it or do they provide the
      space
Whitespace stuff
    Big topic!
    Previous work done, but still opportunities stuff left there
Metric if hard to predict or not
    Good for talking about in paper, good for user too!
        Little red dot (clippy?) in emacs
            Hey this will be slow, maybe you should modularize
    Finds what causes timeouts!
PLDI is November 15th
    Will jump out at me, especially while TAing
New people
    Should they join us, or us join them?
        (they can decide!)
Modularity, should be done automatically or heuristically
    We should be able to handle huge regexps, if built in layers heuristically
On automatic:
    How can we use examples to determine UD MUST be mapped
    Could we use leaf information?
        Leafs not great because just "A", maybe a layer up or 2?
    Examples that help humans SHOULD be able to help us!
Talk to: Fritz Henglein
To state composition thing, if exists 2 regexps find least such that remaps
    Are we looking for least, or something like GCD, greatest common sub
    Kinda a canonical forms thing going on
Convince there is no way to do with confluence strategy
    Try 100% (prove), otherwise find intuition for 99%
Back to quotients
    How do we do it well!
    A real user wants it stripped away, but also retrieved

TODOs:
    Email Fritz
    Proofish thing that single composition is bad
    Think about ways to use examples more
    When2meet for summer AND fall
    Formalize single composition approach, and why it may work well

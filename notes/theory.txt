Goal:
Given regular expressions r_1 and r_2

There exists a lens l,
and regular expressions r_1' and r_2' such that:
L(r_1) = L(r_1')
L(r_2) = L(r_2')
l : r_1' <-> r_2'

if, and only if, there exists a normalized lens nl such that
nl : N(r_1) <-> N(r_2)
nl.putl = l.putl
nl.putr - l.putr

and:

Given normalized regexps nr_1 and nr_2, and examples e
There exists a normalized lens nl : nr_1 <-> nr_2 where nl |= e
if, and only if, our synthesis algorithm will find that lens

Gave a basic overview of lenses
    Bidirectional transformations
    Regular expressions as types
Basic overview of synthesis of bijective lenses
    Subset of normal lens syntax
    Type directed synthesis
    Difficult because of many equivalences of Regular Expressions
    Strategy: normalization
        Turn to DNF lenses
    Can only go so far
        Many star equivalences
        Confluence is difficult
Went over what we do
    Show the input file, and the output boomerang
    Woo hoo everybody is excited by how cool it is
Things for immediate future
    Big examples
        BIG BIG examples
    Augeas examples, random ones, prove that there's nothing we can't do!
Things for future works
    Handle the technical thicket, or prove it isn't possible
    Quotient Lenses
TODOs:
    Anders:
        Make a list of things needed for PLDI, and send it out
        Work on those things (FlashExtract limitations, our power, etc.)
        Assist with Nicolas / Richard getting up to speed
    Nicolas / Richard:
        Get up to speed
        Extended examples in Augeas
